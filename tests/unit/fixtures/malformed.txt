The `lookup_medical_policy` tool has returned the policy document "HF-MRI-KNEE-2024". This document details the criteria for MRI of the knee, which aligns with the patient's request. It also lists the required documentation.

My next steps are:
1. Acknowledge receipt of the policy document to the patient and confirm I have it.
2. Inform the patient about the required documentation based on the policy.
3. Ask the patient for the specific details required by the policy, such as the start and end dates of conservative therapy, documentation of functional limitations, clinical findings, and provider information.
4. Since the policy mentions provider network status, I will need to ask for the NPI numbers of the ordering physician and the imaging facility.
5. I will also need to verify the member's information, so I will use the `lookup_beneficiary` tool. However, I don't have the member ID yet. The patient has not provided their member ID, name, or DOB. I will need to ask for this information.

For now, I will focus on responding to the patient with the policy information and requesting the necessary documentation. I will then ask for their identifying information.

I have reviewed the applicable medical policy, "HF-MRI-KNEE-2024", which outlines the criteria for an MRI of the knee.

To proceed with your prior authorization request, I require the following documentation and information as per the policy:

*   **Initial Injury Date and Mechanism of Injury:** Please provide the exact date of the injury and how it occurred.
*   **Conservative Therapy Details:**
    *   A minimum of 14 consecutive days of documented conservative therapy must have been completed. Please provide the start and end dates of this therapy.
    *   Detailed progress notes for each physical therapy visit during this period, including specific exercises, patient response, and objective measurements.
    *   Documentation of any prescribed home exercise programs.
*   **Functional Limitations:** Please provide specific, quantifiable functional limitations resulting from the injury (e.g., inability to bear weight, specific range of motion deficits, instability during specific movements).
*   **Clinical Findings:** The ordering physician must document positive clinical examination findings. This includes results of specific tests for ligamentous integrity (e.g., Lachman test, anterior/posterior drawer test, varus/valgus stress tests) and the quality of the endpoint.
*   **Failure of Conservative Treatment:** Provider notes must explicitly state the failure of conservative management to resolve symptoms or restore function.
*   **Provider Information:**
    *   NPI number of the ordering physician.
    *   NPI number of the imaging facility.

Additionally, could you please provide your full name, date of birth, and member ID so I can look up your beneficiary information?
